# api-rest

This API was created with:
- Node.js
- Express.js

In order to run it, you must install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After the installation of Node, you need to first install all the Node dependencies: 

```sh
$ npm install
```

Then, you can simply run Node and the API will start fetching requests:
```sh
$ node server.js
```

To test the endpoints I recommend you to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). For example, Insomnia doesn't really tell you where to send a request and expect a download back.

When you test the third endpoint, click on the option of Send & Download and you will expect an .xlsx as result.
